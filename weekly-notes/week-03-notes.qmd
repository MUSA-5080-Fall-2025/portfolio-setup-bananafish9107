## Key Concepts Learned
- Visualization in policy context 
- ggplot2 fundamentals
- EDA:Exploratory Data Analysis
  
## Coding Techniques
- How to display the data (points, bars, lines)
- ggplot(data = your_data) +   aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +   geom_something() +   additional_layers()
- x, y - position
- color - point/line color
- fill - area fill color
- size - point/line size
- shape - point shape
- alpha - transparency

## Questions & Challenges
- Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
- Outliers may represent important communities
- Relationships aren’t always linear
- Visual inspection reveals data quality issues

## Connections to Policy
- Importance of Visualization
- Summary statistics alone (means, variances) can hide critical patterns.
- Visualizations reveal geographic concentrations, demographic differences, temporal trends, and data-quality issues.
- Policy Impact
- Misleading charts—wrong scales, cherry-picked time periods, or hidden uncertainty—can lead to poor resource allocation and inequitable decisions.
- Using ACS data requires ethical practice per the AICP Code of Ethics: always report margins of error, explain reliability (e.g., coefficient of variation), and test for statistical significance.
- Practical Example
- Mapping child poverty data can identify high-risk communities and guide targeted interventions.

## Reflection
- Professional Ethics
- Transparent communication of uncertainty is a professional responsibility, not just a technical detail.
- Small-population areas often have higher sampling error and must not be overlooked or misrepresented.
- Key Takeaways
- Approach data like a detective: explore, question, and verify before modeling.
- Visualization is both a quality check and a storytelling tool.
- Questions for Practice
- How can I ensure my graphics are both accurate and accessible?
- What annotations or explanations help non-experts understand data limitations?

##General workflow
- Load & Inspect – Check dimensions, variable types, and missing values.
- Assess Reliability – Examine margins of error and compute coefficients of variation (CV).
- Visualize Distributions – Use histograms and boxplots to see spread and detect outliers.
- Explore Relationships – Create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and look for non-linear patterns.
- Identify Patterns – Use grouping, clustering, and spatial analysis to detect geographic or demographic structures.
- Question Anomalies – Investigate outliers to distinguish data errors from meaningful signals.
- Document Limitations – Clearly communicate data sources, uncertainty, and caveats in reports and visuals.
- Integrate Data – Use joins (e.g., left_join) to combine multiple datasets such as census and economic indicators, then re-check quality.
