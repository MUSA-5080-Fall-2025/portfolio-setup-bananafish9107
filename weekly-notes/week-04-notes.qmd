## Key Concepts Learned
- Spatial Data Fundamentals
- Vector data model and sf objects
- Reading and inspecting spatial data
- Basic spatial data operations
- Spatial Operations
- Spatial subsetting and filtering
- Spatial joins and relationships
- Measuring distances and areas

- Geometry Operations
- Buffers, intersections, and unions
- Spatial aggregation
- Coordinate Systems

- Understanding projections
- Transforming between coordinate systems

  
## Coding Techniques
- r predicate-structure # Basic structure: st_filter(data_to_filter, reference_geometry, .predicate = relationship)
- “Which counties border Allegheny?” → st_touches
- “Which tracts are IN Allegheny?” → st_within
- “Which tracts overlap a metro area?” → st_intersects
- st_contains()	→Completely contains	→“Districts containing hospitals”
- st_overlaps() -Partial overlap	-“Overlapping service areas”
- st_disjoint()	-No spatial relationship	-“Counties separate from urban areas”
- To simply check current CRS →st_crs(pa_counties)
- To set CRS (ONLY if missing) →pa_counties <- st_set_crs(pa_counties, 4326)
- Transform to different CRS
- Pennsylvania South State Plane (good for PA analysis)
- →pa_counties_projected <- pa_counties %>%   st_transform(crs = 3365)
- Transform to Albers Equal Area (good for area calculations) →pa_counties_albers <- pa_counties %>%   st_transform(crs = 5070) `

Part 6: Putting It All Together
Policy Analysis Workflow
Typical spatial analysis steps:

Load data → Get spatial boundaries and attribute data
Check projections → Transform to appropriate CRS
Join datasets → Combine spatial and non-spatial data
Spatial operations → Buffers, intersections, distance calculations
Aggregation → Summarize across spatial units
Visualization → Maps and charts
Interpretation → Policy recommendations



## Questions & Challenges
- When to Transform
Transform when:
- Calculating areas or distances
- Creating buffers
- Doing geometric operations
- Working with local/regional data


## Connections to Policy
- Service Accessibility Zones (Buffer)
- Environmental Impact Areas (Buffer)


## Reflection


## General workflow
- 1.Load data → Get spatial boundaries and attribute data
- 2.Check projections → Transform to appropriate CRS
- 3.Join datasets → Combine spatial and non-spatial data
- 4.Spatial operations → Buffers, intersections, distance calculations
- 5.Aggregation → Summarize across spatial units
- 6.Visualization → Maps and charts
- 7.Interpretation → Policy recommendations
- conclusion: st_crs() → st_set_crs() → st_transform()
